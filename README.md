## My process

The project utilizes Linode to serve webpages with Apache2 and mod_wsgi, AWS S3 buckets to serve static and images, and AWS RDS to maintain the MySQL database. The HTML and CSS both utilize custom mobile first classes and structure. The backend is handled by Django for organizing models, templates, routing, URLs, and admin functionality. The stock admin functionality makes it easy for system administrators to add in new puppies or update news and information. 

### Built with

- AWS S3 Buckets
- AWS RDS
- Linode Ubuntu Server
- MySQL
- Django
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned a lot about the Django web framework and initializing and maintaining a Linux server for this application. There was also a lot I learned about AWS and the many serves it has to offer. Bootstrap was also a big help in making the templating much easier. I also learned how to make a dynamic light/dark mode changer utilizing JS to easily switch the color pallet but now the colors of images.

### Continued development


I will continue to work on implementing new features, improving the style of the website, maintaining the server, and updating the puppy roster as they find new homes.
